1 call
-> It is a function that helps you change the context of the invoking function. Call() method allows an object to use the method (function) of another object
It immediately invoke the function

2 apply
-> passing argument as array

3 bind
-> It is same as call method but it doesnot invoke the function immediately instead it binds the function and return a function
